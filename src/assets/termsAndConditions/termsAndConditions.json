Risk Disclosure</h3>\n<section>\n  <h4>6.1 Investment and Online Trading Risks.</h4>\n  Crypto-assets are in general extremely volatile and their value can go rapidly up or down. If the value falls substantially,\n  you may also not be able to sell your crypto-assets as there may be less demand for it in the market. Moreover, there are\n  risks associated with utilizing an Internet-based trading system, including, but not limited to, the failure of hardware,\n  software, and Internet connections. Therefore, there can be a substantial risk that you lose money buying, selling, holding,\n  or investing in crypto-assets and crypto-assets may not be suitable for you as a store of value. You should carefully consider\n  whether trading or holding crypto-assets is suitable for you in light of your financial situation.\n</section>\n\n<section>\n  <h4>6.2 Other Technical Risks.</h4>\n  Using crypto-assets and relevant software necessarily involves some degree of risk. Crypto-assets are based on autonomous and\n  largely unregulated digital systems. These systems rely on peer-to-peer networking and cryptography to maintain its integrity\n  and its functioning is often experimental.\n</section>\n\n<section>\n  <h4>6.3 Third-party Integrations.</h4>\n  The Wallet contains libraries developed by third parties that support a particularly crypto-asset network. These libraries are\n  needed to interact with a particular crypto-asset network. We provide access to these third-party libraries as part of the\n  Wallet based on the user's choice to use the specific crypto-asset, but we cannot be held liable for any malfunction.\n</section>\n\n<section>\n  <h4>6.4 Regulatory Risks.</h4>\n  The regulatory and legal status of crypto-assets and associated services is unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is often\n  difficult to predict how exactly will governmental authorities regulate such technologies in future. Any such changes could\n  negatively impact the supported crypto-assets and functioning of the App in various ways.\n</section>\n\n<section>\n  <h4>6.5 Tax Risks.</h4>\n  Proper taxation of gains on crypto-assets investments and trading is often very complex and sometimes also as-yet unclear. The\n  user, therefore, needs to seek professional advice in this respect.\n</section>\n\n<h3>7.
