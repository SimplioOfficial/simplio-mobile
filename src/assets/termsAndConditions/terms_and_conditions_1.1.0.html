  set transaction fees (i.e., too low or too high).
</section>

<h3>6. Risk Disclosure</h3>
<section>
  <h4>6.1 Investment and Online Trading Risks.</h4>
  Crypto-assets are in general extremely volatile and their value can go rapidly up or down. If the
  value falls substantially, you may also not be able to sell your crypto-assets as there may be
  less demand for it in the market. Moreover, there are risks associated with utilizing an
  Internet-based trading system, including, but not limited to, the failure of hardware, software,
  and Internet connections. Therefore, there can be a substantial risk that you lose money buying,
  selling, holding, or investing in crypto-assets and crypto-assets may not be suitable for you as a
  store of value. You should carefully consider whether trading or holding crypto-assets is suitable
  for you in light of your financial situation.
</section>

<section>
  <h4>6.2 Other Technical Risks.</h4>
  Using crypto-assets and relevant software necessarily involves some degree of risk. Crypto-assets
  are based on autonomous and largely unregulated digital systems. These systems rely on
  peer-to-peer networking and cryptography to maintain its integrity and its functioning is often
  experimental.
</section>

<section>
  <h4>6.3 Third-party Integrations.</h4>
  The Wallet contains libraries developed by third parties that support a particularly crypto-asset
  network. These libraries are needed to interact with a particular crypto-asset network. We provide
  access to these third-party libraries as part of the Wallet based on the user's choice to use the
  specific crypto-asset, but we cannot be held liable for any malfunction.
</section>

<section>
  <h4>6.4 Regulatory Risks.</h4>
  The regulatory and legal status of crypto-assets and associated services is unsettled in many
  jurisdictions. It is often difficult to predict how exactly will governmental authorities regulate
  such technologies in future. Any such changes could negatively impact the supported crypto-assets
  and functioning of the App in various ways.
</section>

<section>
  <h4>6.5 Tax Risks.</h4>
  Proper taxation of gains on crypto-assets investments and trading is often very complex and
  sometimes also as-yet unclear. The user, therefore, needs to seek professional advice in this
  respect.
</section>
